# Changelog

This changelog follows the same style that I have seen LiveView, Phoenix, and Elixir use in the past. I'll try to make sure that I maintain it - probably should create some sort of automated process for it... who knows. For now - there's only one release so this should be good enough!

## 1.0.0

This is the first official release! So everything is empty. Read the docs to get started - have fun!

### Bug fixes

### Enhancements

### Deprecations

### Removal of previously deprecated functionality
